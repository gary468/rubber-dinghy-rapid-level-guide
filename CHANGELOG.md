# Changelog

## v1.0.1
- **Fix:** the tracker no longer starts half off the left edge of the screen. It now opens where
  Blizzard's tracker actually sits.
- **Moving the tracker:** Shift + drag its header at any time (or `/rdr unlock`, then drag). Hover the
  header for a reminder. `/rdr reset` puts it back.
- **Route order:** it finishes what you've started first. The quest you're making progress on comes
  first, then quests whose mobs are around you, then other started quests, then new ones. Distance
  to a mob area is measured to its nearest spawn.

## v1.0.0
First public version.
- **Route:** a 40–60 Alliance route across 19 zones, built from QuestieDB.
- **Stops:** each zone becomes a list of stops ordered nearest-first, with quest givers, hand-ins and
  mob areas.
- **Route tracker:** replaces Blizzard's objective tracker, styled like Forever's. It shows live
  quest progress and lists your other quests separately.
- **Quest item buttons** beside the tracker.
- **World map:** a route line, numbered stops and Blizzard's quest objective areas.
- **Minimap pins** for the next stops, and an arrow to the next stop with the distance.
